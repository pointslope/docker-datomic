# Datomic Pro Starter

This Dockerfile defines a base image
for [Datomic Pro Starter Edition](http://www.datomic.com/). It defines
the necessary automation steps for running Datomic, while deferring
all privileged, user-specific configuration to a derived image via
**ONBUILD** instructions.

This approach makes it trivial to customize your own Dockerfile to run
any supported Datomic configuration. To do so, you need only to follow
these steps:

1. Create a `Dockerfile` that is based **FROM** this image
2. Create a `.credentials` file containing your http user and password
   for downloading from **my.datomic.com** in the form `user:pass`
3. Create a `config` folder where your `Dockerfile` resides and place
   your Datomic transactor.properties config file(s) within it
4. Add a **CMD** instruction in your `Dockerfile` with the relative
   path to that file e.g. **config/riak.properties**

No other configuration is necessary. Simply **docker build** and
**docker run** your image.

## Example Folder Structure

    .
    ├── .credentials
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── config
        └── dev-transactor.properties

## Example Dockerfile

    FROM vdart/vdart-datomic-pro-starter
    MAINTAINER John Doe "jdoe@example.org"
    CMD ["config/dev-transactor.properties"]

## Miscellany

The Dockerfile **EXPOSES** ports 4334-6 and establises a **VOLUME** at
`/opt/datomic-pro-$DATOMIC_VERSION/data`.
